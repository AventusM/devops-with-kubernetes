Similar to 2.3, but this time set the context / run with explicit namespace to "course-project". Run the same manifests as in 2.2.txt

OLD INFORMATION HERE REMAINING FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES AND THAT THE EXERCISE HAS BEEN UNDERSTOOD
The following change was applied for the project to work in its new namespace
- OLD: const TODO_BACKEND_BASEURL = "http://kube-node-service:2346" (default namespace)
- NEW: const TODO_BACKEND_BASEURL = "http://kube-node-service.course-project:2346"

NEW: THIS IS THE MOST UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION REGARDING THE EXERCISE
EDIT: As of 2.8, in order to help development and not jump around in various namespaces, all exercises are returned in "course-exercises" namespace
Therefore the BACKEND URL is now --> http://kube-node-service.course-exercises:2346
