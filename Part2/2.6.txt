kubectl apply -f the following directories
- configmap-manifests
- namespace-manifests (if not already)
- persistence-manifests
- ping-pong
- split-getting-started

timestamp-response accesses the process.env.MESSAGE provided in the main-ping-pong.yaml configMap which can be adjusted on the fly through reapplying the .yaml file (deployment must be restarted, however)
