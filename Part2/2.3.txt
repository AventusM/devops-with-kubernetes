Sidenote: It is probably easier to keep using set-context and deploy manifests instead of manually applying namespaces with each kubectl command

1. kubectl apply -f namespace/manifests to create the course-exercises namespace

To create deployments/services in the namespace (2 ways)
1. kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=course-exercises
- This allows for kubectl apply -f manifests to start in the set namespace by default
- NOTE: The required manifests are the same as in 2.1.txt. 

2. kubectl --namespace=course-exercises apply -f manifests explicitly


Confirm that pods are running  in "course-exercises" namespace with the following
- kubectl get pods --namespace=course-exercises
