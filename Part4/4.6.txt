1. kubectl apply -f namespace-manifests --> then switch to course-exercises namespace
2. install helm/nats --> helm install my-nats nats/nats
3. kubectl apply -f following supporting directories
  - persistence-manifests
  - secret-manifests
  - statefulset-manifests
4. cd to project and "kubectl apply -k ." in the root of it
  - deployment.yaml got updates by following material (adding support for NATS)
  - sealedsecret.yaml added for the telegram http token
  - project-broadcaster directory added to the root of part4 directory for source code of the broadcaster

The application sends a single message even with multiple replicas on the broadcaster (doesn't seem like any specific code changes were necessary for this one except to following the node telegram library)
