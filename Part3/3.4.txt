To run the application properly, the database must have the table setup properly.
Unfortunately, I've been unable to do them at branch creation, but there is a bash script created to seed the data (with unsecured credentials, due to lack of bash skills).
If the bash script wont work, copy/paste the login/create table/insert data into table (last one optional) for the node.js app to run.
The application should be able to be run simply by triggering the workflow (changing something on project or project-backend directories).
It creates a branch-specific environment inside the cluster
