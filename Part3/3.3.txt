This exercise assumes (on default) that the namespace is default (backend fetch url namespace removed in anticipation of 3.4 and 3.5)
Most relevant changes were in introducing the .github/workflow/project.yaml and adjusting some small variables / endpoints in the project code as the GKE ingress is sub-par (/todos endpoint wont work while /todos/ will (2nd backslash))

To run the project, it should be done in two phases.

1. Setup the secrets and the database
e.g. kubectl apply -f
  - secret-manifests
  - statefulset-manifests

Then run kubectl exec -it postgres-ss-0 bash and login --> create table --> insert some data (optional)
  - psql -h $(hostname -i) -U user -p 5432 db (on prompt put 'test' as password)
  - CREATE TABLE todos (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, text VARCHAR(140));
  - INSERT INTO todos VALUES (DEFAULT 'Any text goes');

2. Do any changes to the Part3/project or Part3/project-backend directories (non-breaking ones, ofcourse)
- It should trigger a workflow through kustomization.yaml, that ends in a kube-node workload/deployment being created and available on a url with a type similar to http://35.201.68.5/ (running at the time of writing)
