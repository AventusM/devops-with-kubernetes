NOTICE: Use the course-exercises namespace (apply namespace-manifests and run kubectl config set-context --current --namespace course-exercises)
- Main application backend url runs there. Probably could move parts of it to ConfigMap etc.

1. Apply kubectl apply -f to the following directories

- configmap-manifests
- persistenceclaim-manifests
- secret-manifests
- statefulset-manifests

- split-getting-started/manifests
- ping-pong/manifests (container image got changed to gke version due to PathPrefixStrip not being supported). app.get() functions had the adjustments done, including adding a new app.get("/") route which gke used to do a health check on. Maybe ~6 hours of my life was spent on finding solution for this situation -.-
- ingress-manifests

The app should be accessible through following paths

- "/"
- "/pingpong/" (notice the 2nd slash, based on the only allowed ingress wildcard configuration)
- "/pingpong/increase"
