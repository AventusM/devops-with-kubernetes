1. Push the project to gcr (through project.yaml) to a new branch (creates a new namespace)
  - the workflow is triggered by any changes to project or project-backend in Part3 directory
  - confirm that it exists on google cloud console
2. Merge the new branch with the main branch
3. Delete the new namespace (project-branch-delete.yaml follows the file that is on the main branch)
  - The workflow is triggered by a deleted branch (any at the moment)
  - confirm that the namespace (its contents mainly!) doesn't exist anymore on google cloud console
