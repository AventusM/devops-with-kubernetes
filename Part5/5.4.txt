Rancher advantages comparison with OpenShift
- Installation is considerably shorter (hours to single days, compared to ~ week reports on OpenShift).
- Uses tooling from CNCF (cloud native computing foundation) vs more proprietary approach from OpenShift.
- Completely open source vs community version only on OpenShift.
- Capable of running kubernetes anywhere.
- More current kubernetes version in general (max 1 version back vs OpenShift following up to 3 versions back).
- No vendor lock-in --> switching from managed to vanilla kubernetes is possible.
- Not an IBM product, although it means that Rancher lacks in partner ecosystem and bundle options (OpenShift can look attractive from a cost standpoint).
