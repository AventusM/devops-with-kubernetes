Requirements

1. For local data persistance, docker container is required to be changed
- docker exec k3d-k3s-default-agent-0 mkdir -p /tmp/kube

2. It is assumed that the following command is used to run the cluster:
- k3d cluster create --port '8082:30080@agent[0]' -p 8081:80@loadbalancer --agents 2

Apply manifests from project and persistence-manifests directories (whole directories at once possible in this case)
Access the project at localhost:8082
