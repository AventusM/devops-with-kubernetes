For local data persistance, docker container is required to be changed
- docker exec k3d-k3s-default-agent-0 mkdir -p /tmp/kube

Slightly messy, but running following manifest files should do the trick
- kubectl -f apply following

(Order of commands below doesn't really matter, just easier to have things grouped)

DEPLOYMENT / INGRESS / SERVICE / PERSISTENT VOLUME (+CLAIM)
1. split-getting-started deployment
2. split-getting-started manifest service

3. persistence-manifests persistentvolume
4. persistence-manifests persistentvolumeclaim

5. ping-pong deployment
6. ping-pong manifest ingress
7. ping-pong manifest service
